          <li>*Pig Game , the one who first scores more than are equal to winning score is declared as winner</li>
          <li>How to Play???</li>
          <li>*Each player will get a chance one after one for rolling the dice(Roll Dice)</li>
          <li>*There are two possibilities after rolling the dice, if the rolled dice value is one(1) ,then the chance for rolling the dice goes to opponent</li>
          <li>*If we get other than one(1) then the dice value is added to current score and..</li>
          <li>*Here, the interesting part,we can add the current score to total score by clicking on Hold the dice key, but we lose the chance to roll again.. </li>
          <li>*If you want roll again, then keep in mind we can roll any number of times without holding the dice but there is a chance you may get one (1) at anytime, then you will lose all the gained current score and also you lose your turn to roll the dice again</li>
          <li>*It goes on until any of the player will score winning points </li>
           <li>NOTE:At Present the winning points for game is 100, in future you will get an option to set the winning points(20,50,100,200,500,1000...)</li>
           <li>Keep Playing and Keep Winning</li>
